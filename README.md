## **Description**

This project was created by Dev10 associates with Genesis 10, and is focused on retail services in the United States. 

Specifically, we looked at nationwide retail data, including product and industry classifications from 1960 to 2022, completed a time series analysis of retail sales with the following independent variables: consumer price index (CPI), real person income (RPI), nationwide number of retail employees (USTRADE), and nationwide number of wholesale employees (USWTRADE). 

The goal of this time series analysis is a machine learning model that aims to predict future retail sales in the United States. This model will serve to aid our hypothetical client in streamlining their supply chain logistics beyond simple tactical order fulfilment methods and practices, which will ultimately result in a lower cost of goods sold, moreover maximizing profitability.

## **Questions**

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. How have total sales in retail changed over time, as well as within in the subcategories
(by NAICS codes)?

      a. Can we identify trends within the retail data?

2. What industries have the highest number of sales?

3. Is there correlation between CPI, RPI, USTRADE, or USWTRADE and retail sales?

4. Can we use historical retail sales data to predict future trends in retail sales?

5. How do product sales compare when sold in different types of establishments? (This
would be looking at something like candy sales or alcohol sales and seeing how their
sales compare when sold at like a gas station vs a grocery store or some other location)

      a. Which products vary the most by industry?

      b. Which industries tend to perform better?

      c. Which products sold the most in 2017
